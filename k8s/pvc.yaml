# Shared PersistentVolumeClaim for uploaded chat.db files and file backups.
# Uses ReadWriteOnce because the default local-path provisioner does not
# support ReadWriteMany. Both web and extraction pods must schedule on
# the same node (the node where the PVC is first bound). If you use a
# network-backed StorageClass (NFS, Longhorn, etc.) you can switch to RWX.
